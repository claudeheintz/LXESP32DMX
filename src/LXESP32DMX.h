   The LXESP32DMX library supports output and input of DMX using the UART
   serial output of an ESP32 microcontroller.  LXESP32DMX uses
   UART2for output by default.  This means that hardware Serial
   can still be used for USB communication.
   (do not use default Serial1 pins because it is connected to flash)
   
   Input functionality requires replacing the esp32-hal-uart.c
   files in Arduino/hardware/espressif/esp32/cores/esp32/
   
   The necessary modified esp32-hal-uart file is included in the
   extras/modified_hal-uart folder of this library.
   Or use the forked Arduino Core at https://github.com/claudeheintz/arduino-esp32
   
   @section  HISTORY
   v1.0	- first release
   v1.1 - simplifies modifications to esp32-hal-uart.c required for DMX input
   v1.2 - improve multi-task compatibility
   v2.x - rewrite for ESP32 SDK 2.0.2
   v3.0 - Roeland Kluit;
           Updated to allow multiple instances for multiple UARTS
           Moved all external functions into static members
           Added timeouts to semaphore operations
           Added CPU core selection for tasks

@class LX32DMX
@abstract
   LX32DMX is a driver for sending or receiving DMX using an ESP32's UART2.
   
   LX32DMX output mode continuously sends DMX once its interrupts have been enabled using startOutput().
   Use setSlot() to set the level value for a particular DMX dimmer/address/channel.
   DMX output uses the ESP32's UART2 TX pin (GPIO17).
   
   LX32DMX input mode receives DMX using the ESP32's UART2 RX pin (GPIO16)
   LX32DMX continuously updates its DMX buffer once its interrupts have been enabled using startInput()
   and DMX data is received by UART2.
   Use getSlot() to read the level value for a particular DMX dimmer/address/channel.
   
   LX32DMX input requires replacing the uart hardware abstraction files to allow breaks to be converted
   to SLIP encoded serial to divide the incoming DMX serial into packets.
   
   LX32DMX is used with a single instance called ESP32DMX.
