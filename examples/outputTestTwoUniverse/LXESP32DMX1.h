@class LX32DMX1
@abstract
   LX32DMX1 is a driver for sending or receiving DMX using an ESP32's UART2.
   
   LX32DMX1 output mode continuously sends DMX once its interrupts have been enabled using startOutput().
   Use setSlot() to set the level value for a particular DMX dimmer/address/channel.
   DMX output uses the ESP32's UART2 TX pin (GPIO17).
   
   LX32DMX1 input mode receives DMX using the ESP32's UART2 RX pin (GPIO16)
   LX32DMX1 continuously updates its DMX buffer once its interrupts have been enabled using startInput()
   and DMX data is received by UART2.
   Use getSlot() to read the level value for a particular DMX dimmer/address/channel.
   
   LX32DMX1 input requires replacing the uart hardware abstraction files to allow breaks to be converted
   to SLIP encoded serial to divide the incoming DMX serial into packets.
   
   LX32DMX1 is used with a single instance called ESP32DMX1.
